		<description>The AnswerScorer loops through each Question (there should only be one in each document). For each Question, the AnswerScorer loops through the candidate Answer annotations and scores them.

For this implementation, the scoring methodology is a simple NGram overlap rule: for each NGram contained in the candidate Answer, the AnswerScorer looks to see if that NGram is also contained in the Question. If so, it increments a “matching_ngrams” counter by 1. The final score feature is simply the count of “matching_ngrams” / the total number of n-grams contained in the candidate Answer.

When the score is returned, a new AnswerScore annotation is created. This annotation spans the text of the answer sentence. In addition, it has a score feature (that stores the score), as well as an answer feature (that has a pointer to the Answer object that was used during scoring).</description>
